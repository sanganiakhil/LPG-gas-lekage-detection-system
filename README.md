# LPG-gas-lekage-detection-system
Background of the Idea: 
An LPG gas sensor detector is use to detect the presence of liquid petroleum gas leakage that may be source of risk and help to avoid information sent to fire station being delayed if any accident happened.
It will detect the presence of gasses using MQ2 sensor, if the sensor detect the level of gasses is exceeding the normal level it will send an information through the phone apps through Internet of Thing (IOT).
Gas sensor MQ2 is a sensor that detects gases, specifically hydrogen (H2), Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), Methane (CH4), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Alcohol, Propane, Smoke at the atmosphere. 
DHT11 is use to detect an increment of temperature if the fire happens, it will send an alert message through android apps and location via GPS through IOT to the nearest fire station.
It is used to sense a high temperature or positive change of temperature and it will send a pulse to microcontroller. This DHT11 sensor not only contains calibrated digital outputs of temperature but it also contains calibrated digital signal of humidity.
This sensor contains resistive sense of wet components and an NTC temperature measurement devices and connected with a high performance 8-bit microcontroller.
